    "Here's the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for ring accuracy.  If you aim for the triple ring, all the\n",
    "misses go to a single ring (some to the inner one, some to the outer\n",
    "one, but the model doesn't distinguish between these). If you aim for\n",
    "the double ring (at the edge of the board), half the misses (e.g. 0.05\n",
    "if miss=0.1) go to the single ring, and half off the board. (We will\n",
    "agree to call the off-the-board 'target' by the name 'OFF'.) If you\n",
    "aim for a thick single ring, it is about 5 times thicker than the thin\n",
    "rings, so your miss ratio is reduced to 1/5th, and of these, half go to\n",
    "the double ring and half to the triple.  So with miss=0.1, 0.01 will go\n",
    "to each of the double and triple ring.  Finally, for the bulls-eyes. If\n",
    "you aim for the single bull, 1/4 of your misses go to the double bull and\n",
    "3/4 to the single ring.  If you aim for the double bull, it is tiny, so\n",
    "your miss rate is tripled; of that, 2/3 goes to the single ring and 1/3\n",
    "to the single bull ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for section accuracy.  Half your miss rate goes one section clockwise\n",
    "and half one section counter-clockwise from your target. The clockwise \n",
    "order of sections is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aim for the bull (single or double) and miss on rings, then the\n",
    "section you end up on is equally possible among all 20 sections.  But\n",
    "independent of that you can also miss on sections; again such a miss\n",
    "is equally likely to go to any section and should be recorded as being\n",
    "in the single ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to build a model for these probabilities, and define the\n",
    "function outcome(target, miss), which takes a target (like 'T20') and\n",
    "a miss ration (like 0.1) and returns a dict of {target: probability}\n",
    "pairs indicating the possible outcomes.  You will also define\n",
    "best_target(miss) which, for a given miss ratio, returns the target \n",

One way to implement this idea is to have separate functions to return probability distributions for ring and section outcomes.

In this explanation I will name the rings 'S', 'D' and 'T' for single/double/triple, along with 'OFF', 'SB' and 'DB'. I will name the sections '1' to '20', along with 'B' (encompassing the whole bulls-eye section, SB and DB).\n",

In this explanation I will name the rings 'S', 'D' and 'T' for single/double/triple, along with 'OFF', 'SB' and 'DB'.
